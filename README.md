# project.py-2018

Project.py is a high level interface program used by Liquid Argon TPC
experiments to create, submit and monitor physics analysis jobs and
workflows that use the LarSoft Framework.

Project.py was originally developed by Herbert Greenlee for us in the
MicroBooNE experiment.  The success of the project has lead to its
adoption across a wide range of neutrino physics experiments including
MicroBooNE, Lariat, DUNE/ProtoDUNE, ICARUS and the Short Baseline
Neutrino (SBN) program at Fermilab.

Project.py-2018 is the next generation of Liquid Argon submission
software, designed to interact with large computing facilities,
storage systems and new analysis tools.
